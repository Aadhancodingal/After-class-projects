        <h2>Paintings</h2>
        <p>Painting is a visual art, which is characterized by the practice of applying paint,
        pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface (called the "matrix" or "support").
        The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but other implements,
        such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, may be used. One who produces paintings is called a
        painter.</p>
