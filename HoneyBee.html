<h1>Honey bees</h1>
<p>Honey bees helps to get food and grow plants</p>
<h2>What is a honeybee ?</h2>
<p><mark>Honey Bees are one of the most recognisable insects and are the most commonly domesticated bee species
 in the world</mark>. They are somewhat variable in colour but are usually brown with a banded dull yellow
  and brown abdomen. The head, thorax and abdomen are densely covered in hair.</p>
 <h2>What does honeybees do?</h2> 
 <p>The honeybee plays a vital role in the pollination of flowering plants, including crops. After all,
 one-third of the food we eat depends upon pollination, including almonds, apples, berries, cucumbers and
melons.</p>
<h2> Where did it come from?</h2>
<h3>Origin:</h3>
<p>A study published in Nature Genetics found that honey bees likely originated from an ancient lineage
 of cavity-nesting bees that arrived in Asia around 300,000 years ago. </p>
 <h3>Spread: </h3>
 <p>The bees then spread rapidly across Europe and Africa.</p>
 <h3>Genetic diversity:</h3>
<p>Honey bees have a high level of genetic diversity.</p>
<h3>Adaptation:</h3>
<p>The bee genome has several “hot spots” that allowed honey bees to adapt to new geographic areas. </p>
