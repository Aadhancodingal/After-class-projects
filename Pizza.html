  <h1>Pizza</h1>
  <p>pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped
     with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese,
      and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting,
     using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.</p>
